	AF_INET is the family of address for IPv4
	Socket programming in C++ is the way of combining or connecting two nodes with each other over a network
	so that they can communicate easily without losing any data.
	One socket listen to a port and the other reach the first one to form a connection
	Socket is something connected to a port  (number 80 in our case)
	the server just wait, listen to the socket for a client to make a connextion request
	To make a connection request : the client try to connect to the server, on the server's machine and port
	The client needs to identify himself
	Bind in computer programming : bind allows a resource to be sent or received.
	int bind(int socket, const struct sockaddr *address, socklen_t address_len);
	(carefull in c++ there is a std::bind but doesnt do the same)
	For example, one may bind a request to TCP/IP, indicating that it is ready to receive or send information.

	Generally, the application requesting the data is called the client.
	The application servicing the request is called the server.

	How to make everything work together :
		- Socket: Create a new communication |Client and Server|
		- Bind: Attach a local address to a socket |SERVER|
		- Listen: Announce willingness to accept connections, goes on passive mode and wait for the connection |SERVER|
		- Connect: Actively attempt to establish a connection |CLIENT|
		- Accept: Block caller until a connection request arrives, it extract the first connection request on the queue of pending connections(to the listening sockfd), creacte a new connected socket and returns a new file descriptor referring to that socket|SERVER|
		- Send: Send some data over a connection |Client and Server|
		- Receive: Receive some data over a connection |Client and Server|
		- Close: Releasegi the connection

	To understand nginx parsing https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NGINX-Conf-2018-slides_Hulegaard-config-analysis.pdf;

A faire :
 - Finir le parsing du server
 - Quand on a recu un message, on cree une stuct avec les infos puis il faut traiter la requete en fonction de la structure.

	class Request{
		private:
			int _nPort; //
			std::string _nameServ;
			std::string _methode;
			std::string _Query;
			std::sstream _content; // http 1.1 rcp par exemple un fichier
	}
 - Query ? page requise
 - Requete cgi

 - Checker la reponse a ma requete.
